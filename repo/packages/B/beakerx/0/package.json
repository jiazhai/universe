  "preInstallNotes": "This DC/OS Service is currently in preview. There may be bugs, incomplete features, incorrect documentation, or other discrepancies.\n\nFind the server token to authenticate in your service's stdout\n\nAdvanced Installation options notes\n\nstorage / persistence: create local persistent volumes for internal storage files to survive across restarts or failures. \n\nstorage / host_volume: if /tmp for example is used it will try to mount /tmp/beakerx into your /home/beakerx directory as a persistent_data folder, if persistence is not selected, this package can use a local volume in the host for storage, like a local directory or an NFS mount. The parameter host_volume controls the path in the host in which these volumes will be created, which MUST be the same on all nodes of the cluster.\n\nNOTE: If you didn't select persistence in the storage section, or provided a valid value for host_volume on installation,\nYOUR DATA WILL NOT BE SAVED IN ANY WAY.\n\nnetworking / port: This DC/OS service can be accessed from any other application through a NAMED VIP in the format service_name.marathon.l4lb.thisdcos.directory:port. Check status of the VIP in the Network tab of the DC/OS Dashboard (Enterprise DC/OS only).\n\nnetworking / external_access: create an entry in Marathon-LB for accessing the service from outside of the cluster\n\nnetworking / external_access_port: port to be used in Marathon-LB for accessing the service. \n\nnetworking / external_public_agent_ip: dns for Marathon-LB, typically set to your public agents public ip.\n\n Access your BeakerX Server.",
